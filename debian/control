Description: Make ssh v2 connections with Python (Documentation)
 "Paramiko" is a combination of the Esperanto words for "paranoid" and "friend".
 It's a module for Python 2.7/3.4+ that implements the SSH2 protocol for secure
 (encrypted and authenticated) connections to remote machines. Unlike SSL (aka
 TLS), SSH2 protocol does not require hierarchical certificates signed by a
 powerful central authority. You may know SSH2 as the protocol that replaced
 Telnet and rsh for secure access to remote shells, but the protocol also
 includes the ability to open arbitrary channels to remote services across the
 encrypted tunnel (this is how SFTP works, for example).
 .
 This is the documentation for the package.
